Reviewing: Team B (Scavenger hunt)

Stakeholder Review:

	a.	They were very professional about it. I felt at ease using the appa ddn had a great ueser testing experience. There were enough systems to test and I was aable to actually feel out what their full vision for the appa was as well as point out some things that I could break. They took notes and didn't influence my decision making at all.

	b.	They have pushed a lot of code out and it looks really good so far!
